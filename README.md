# Analysis and Prediction of Uber and Lyft Price

## Ⅰ. Introduction:
Unlike public transportation, Uber and Lyft’s ride prices are not constant and fluctuate greatly. And their demand is more dispersive and uncertain. In our project, we want to analyze the cab demand and predict the ride price based on given conditions. Our final goal is to give suggestions to drivers and passengers. The driver could find the location where may have higher demand; and the passenger may avoid a high ride-price situation. Python is used as our data analysis tool, which is popular in the field of data mining and machine learning. To predict the ride price, we build a random forest model using the given conditions. Besides, we also employ some packages in Python to show the relationship between cab demand and different features.

## Ⅱ. Problem Description:
There are three main problems we try to solve:
    1. Can we accurately predict the cab price?
    2. What features are more important on cab price?
    3. When and where is the cab demand higher?

Our main goal is to build a model to predict ride price based on given conditions. As we all know, distance, time, car type and so on, may impact on cab price. If we know a certain condition, can we use it to predict a right ride price? Besides, we also wonder which features are more important on cab price. As costumers, we always want to reduce our cost. If we know what conditions may cause high cost, we can avoid them and save money. For drivers, they are more concerned for earning money. As a result, increasing cab order will benefit to drives. Then where and when the cab demand higher is important and it is our third problem.
