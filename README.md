# Analysis and Prediction of Uber and Lyft Price

## Ⅰ. Introduction:
Unlike public transportation, Uber and Lyft’s ride prices are not constant and fluctuate greatly. And their demand is more dispersive and uncertain. In our project, we want to analyze the cab demand and predict the ride price based on given conditions. Our final goal is giving suggestions to drivers and passengers. The driver could find the location where may have higher demand; and the passenger may avoid high ride-price situation. Python is used as our data analysis tool, which is popular in the field of data mining and machine learning. To predict the ride price, we build a random forest model using given conditions. Besides, we also employ some packages in Python to show the relationship between cab demand and different features.
